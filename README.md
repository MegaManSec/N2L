URN (RFC 2141 and RFC 2169) is an important part of internet history.

They are predicated on RFCs 1737, 2141, 2288, 2611, 3406, and RFC 8141 
obsoletes both RFCs 2141 and 3406.

URNs are concerned about long-term, persistent, location-independent 
resource identifiers. An example of an urn is:
`urn:ietf:rfc:2648`, which corresponds to the IETF's RFC 2648.

RFC 2169 describes the resolution of urn links in an HTTP-context, 
and involves using a 'resolver' to proxy requests to an urn repository.

Historically, the N2L perl script has acted as a resolver.

Given the importance of the N2L perl script in the context of urn, 
it should be ensured that the script is saved for historical purposes.
